### About Navigation

The **Navigation menu** is an important component of the Cloud Consoleâ€”it offers quick access to the platform's services and also outlines its offerings. If you scroll through the menu, you will see that there are seven categories of Google Cloud services:

- **Compute:** houses a variety of machine types that support any type of workload. The different computing options let you decide how involved you want to be with operational details and infrastructure amongst other things.
- **Storage:** data storage and database options for structured or unstructured, relational or non relational data.
- **Networking:** services that balance application traffic and provision security rules amongst other things.
- **Cloud Operations:** a suite of cross-cloud logging, monitoring, trace, and other service reliability tools.
- **Tools:** services for developers managing deployments and application build pipelines.
- **Big Data:** services that allow you to process and analyze large datasets.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** a suite of APIs that run specific artificial intelligence and machine learning tasks on Google Cloud.

## Understanding Regions and Zones
Certain Compute Engine resources live in regions or zones. A region is a specific geographical location where you can run your resources. Each region has one or more zones. For example, the us-central1 region denotes a region in the Central United States that has zones ```us-central1-a```, ```us-central1-b```, ```us-central1-c```, and ```us-central1-f```.
![](https://github.com/Psingh12354/Google-Cloud/blob/main/Region.PNG)

Resources that live in a zone are referred to as zonal resources. Virtual machine Instances and persistent disks live in a zone. To attach a persistent disk to a virtual machine instance, both resources must be in the same zone. Similarly, if you want to assign a static IP address to an instance, the instance must be in the same region as the static IP.

### Create a new instance from the Cloud Console

In this section, you'll learn how to create new pre-defined machine types with Compute Engine from the Cloud Console.

In the Cloud Console, on the top left of the screen, select **Navigation menu > Compute Engine > VM Instances:**

![](https://github.com/Psingh12354/Google-Cloud/blob/main/Instance.PNG)
This may take a minute to initialize for the first time.

To create a new instance, click **Create**.

![](https://github.com/Psingh12354/Google-Cloud/blob/main/create.PNG)

There are many parameters you can configure when creating a new instance. Use the following for this lab:
![](https://github.com/Psingh12354/Google-Cloud/blob/main/instance1.PNG)
![](https://github.com/Psingh12354/Google-Cloud/blob/main/instance2.PNG)

Click **Create.**

Wait for it to finish - it shouldn't take more than a minute.

Once finished, you should see the new virtual machine in the **VM Instances** page.

To SSH into the virtual machine, click on **SSH** on the right hand side. This launches a SSH client directly from your browser.

![](https://github.com/Psingh12354/Google-Cloud/blob/main/SSh.PNG)

## Install a NGINX web server
Now you'll install NGINX web server, one of the most popular web servers in the world, to connect your virtual machine to something.

Once SSH'ed, get ```root``` access using ```sudo```:
```
sudo su -
```
As the ```root``` user, update your OS:
```
apt-get update
```
(Output)
```
Get:1 http://security.debian.org stretch/updates InRelease [94.3 kB]
Ign http://deb.debian.org strech InRelease
Get:2 http://deb.debian.org strech-updates InRelease [91.0 kB]
...
```
### Install NGINX:
```
apt-get install nginx -y
```
(Output)
```
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following additional packages will be installed:
...
```
### Check that NGINX is running:
```
ps auwx | grep nginx
```
(Output)
```
root      2330  0.0  0.0 159532  1628 ?        Ss   14:06   0:00 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on;
www-data  2331  0.0  0.0 159864  3204 ?        S    14:06   0:00 nginx: worker process
www-data  2332  0.0  0.0 159864  3204 ?        S    14:06   0:00 nginx: worker process
root      2342  0.0  0.0  12780   988 pts/0    S+   14:07   0:00 grep nginx
```
Awesome! To see the web page, go to the Cloud Console and click the External IP link of the virtual machine instance. You can also see the web page by adding the ```External``` IP to ```http://EXTERNAL_IP/``` in a new browser window or tab.
![](https://github.com/Psingh12354/Google-Cloud/blob/main/SSh.PNG)

You should see this default web page:

### Create a new instance with gcloud

Rather than using the Cloud Console to create a virtual machine instance, you can use the command line tool gcloud, which is pre-installed in Google Cloud Shell. Cloud Shell is a Debian-based virtual machine loaded with all the development tools you'll need (gcloud, git, and others) and offers a persistent 5GB home directory.

In the Cloud Shell, create a new virtual machine instance from the command line using ```gcloud```:
```
gcloud compute instances create gcelab2 --machine-type n1-standard-2 --zone us-central1-c
```
(Output)
```
Created [...gcelab2].
NAME     ZONE           MACHINE_TYPE  ...    STATUS
gcelab2  us-central1-c  n1-standard-2 ...    RUNNING
```
The instance created has these default values:

- The latest Debian 9 (stretch) image.
- The n1-standard-2 machine type. In this lab you can select one of these other machine types if you'd like: n1-highmem-4 or n1-highcpu-4. When you're working on a project outside of Qwiklabs, you can also specify a custom machine type.
- A root persistent disk with the same name as the instance; the disk is automatically attached to the instance.
Run ```gcloud compute instances create --help``` to see all the defaults.
```
Note: You can set the default region and zones that gcloud uses if you are always working within one region/zone and you don't want to append the --zone flag every time. Do this by running these commands :

gcloud config set compute/zone ...

gcloud config set compute/region ...
```
To exit help, press **Ctrl+c**.

Check out your instances. Select **Navigation menu > Compute Engine > VM instances.** You should see the 2 instances you created in this lab.

![](https://github.com/Psingh12354/Google-Cloud/blob/main/SSh.PNG)

a new gcelab added here

Finally, you can SSH into your instance using ```gcloud``` as well. Make sure you add your zone, or omit the ```--zone``` flag if you've set the option globally:
```
gcloud compute ssh gcelab2 --zone us-central1-c
```
(Output)
```
WARNING: The public SSH key file for gcloud does not exist.
WARNING: The private SSH key file for gcloud does not exist.
WARNING: You do not have an SSH key for gcloud.
WARNING: [/usr/bin/ssh-keygen] will be executed to generate a key.

```
Now you'll type **Y** to continue.
```
Do you want to continue? (Y/n)
```
**Enter** through the passphrase section to leave the passphrase empty.
```

After connecting, you disconnect from SSH by exiting from the remote shell:
```
exit
```

<h1 align=center><i><b>Getting Started with Cloud Shell & gcloud</b></i></h1>

### Project Id

```
gcloud compute project-info describe --project <your_project_ID>
```

## Setting environment variables

Environment variables are variables that define your environment. Define your own variables and save yourself time when writing scripts that contain APIs or executables.

Make a couple of environment variables:

```
export PROJECT_ID=<your_project_ID>
```

Set your ZONE environment variable (use the value for zone from the earlier command):

```
export ZONE=<your_zone>
```

Verify that your variables were set properly:

```
echo $PROJECT_ID
echo $ZONE
```

## Create a virtual machine with gcloud

Create a new virtual machine instance using ```gcloud```. In the following command you'll use:

```gcloud compute``` which enables you to easily manage your Compute Engine resources in a friendlier format than using the Compute Engine API.
```instances create``` creates a new instance.
Run the following to create your vm:

```
gcloud compute instances create gcelab2 --machine-type n1-standard-2 --zone $ZONE
```
(Output)

![](https://github.com/Psingh12354/Google-Cloud/blob/main/outputgit.png)

### If you got a error : 

```
ERROR: (gcloud.compute.instances.create) The required property [project] is not currently set.
You may set it for your current workspace by running:
  $ gcloud config set project VALUE
or it can be set temporarily by the environment variable [CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT]
student_03_c58135da19e3@cloudshell:~$
```

### Use this :

```
gcloud config set command <Project_ID> //command can be project or something else with id 
```

- The name of the vm is "gcelab2",
- You're using the ```--machine-type``` flag to specify the machine type as "n1-standard-2"
- You're using the ```--zone``` flag to specify that it gets created in the zone you defined with your environment variable.

## Using gcloud commands

```gcloud``` offers simple usage guidelines that are available by adding the ```-h```flag (for help) onto the end of any ```gcloud``` invocation.

Run the following command in Cloud Shell:

```
gcloud -h
```

More verbose help can be obtained by appending ```--help``` flag, or executing ```gcloud``` help command. Run the following in Cloud Shell:
```
gcloud config --help
```
Use the **Enter** key or the **Spacebar** to scroll through the help content.

Type q to exit the content.

Now run the following command:

```
gcloud help config
```

You can see that the ```gcloud config --help``` and ```gcloud help config``` commands are equivalent. Both give long, detailed help.

[gcloud Global Flags](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/) govern the behavior of commands on a per-invocation level. Flags override any values set in SDK properties.

View the list of configurations in your environment:

```
gcloud config list
```

To check how other properties are set, see all properties by calling:

```
gcloud config list --all
```

List your components:

```
gcloud components list
```

Here you will see what components are ready for you to use in this lab. Next you'll install a new component.

## Auto-completion

```gcloud interactive``` has auto prompting for commands and flags, and displays inline help snippets in the lower section as the command is typed.

Static information, like command and sub-command names, and flag names and enumerated flag values, are auto-completed using dropdown menus.

Install the beta components:

```
sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk
```

Enter the ```gcloud interactive``` mode:

```
gcloud beta interactive
```

When using the interactive mode, click on the **Tab** key to complete file path and resource arguments. If a dropdown menu appears, use the **Tab** key to move through the list, and the **Space bar** to select your choice.

Try it out! Start typing the following command, using auto-complete to finish the command:

```
gcloud compute instances describe <your_vm>
```

Across the bottom of Cloud Shell you can see the shortcut to toggle this feature. Try out the F2 toggle:

F2:help:STATE Toggles the active help section, ON when enabled, OFF when disabled.

## SSH into your vm instance
```gcloud compute``` makes connecting to your instances easy. The ```gcloud``` compute ssh command provides a wrapper around ```SSH```, which takes care of authentication and the mapping of instance name to IP address.

Use ```gcloud compute ssh``` to SSH into your vm:

```
gcloud compute ssh gcelab2 --zone $ZONE
```

(Output)

```
WARNING: The public SSH key file for gcloud does not exist.
WARNING: The private SSH key file for gcloud does not exist.
WARNING: You do not have an SSH key for gcloud.
WARNING: [/usr/bin/ssh-keygen] will be executed to generate a key.
This tool needs to create the directory
[/home/gcpstaging306_student/.ssh] before being able to generate SSH Keys.
```

Type "Y" to continue:

```
Do you want to continue? (Y/n)
```

Press the **Enter** key through the passphrase section to leave the passphrase empty.

```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase)
```

You don't need to do anything here, so disconnect from SSH by exiting from the remote shell by typing "exit":

```
exit
```
You should be back at your project's command prompt.

## Use the Home directory
Now try out your Home directory. The contents of your Cloud Shell Home directory persists across projects between all Cloud Shell sessions, even after the virtual machine terminates and is restarted.

Change your current working directory:

```
cd $HOME
```

Open your ```.bashrc``` configuration file using ```vi``` text editor:

```
vi ./.bashrc
```

The editor opens and displays the contents of the file. Press the ```ESC``` key and then ```:wq``` to exit the editor.
